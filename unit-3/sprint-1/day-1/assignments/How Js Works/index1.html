<!-- So, from the code, we can see that slice is returning a new array so it is immutable while splice is changing the main array into a new array so it is mutable. -->

<!-- difference between const and object.freeze() -->
<!-- 
Its all about mutability, so const prevents from reassignment and the value can be changed but object.freeze is immutable so the value can not be changed -->
