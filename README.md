# Coding_assignments
Masai school coding assignments, evaluations and projects. After every coding class we get assignment to work upon. So it is a good idea to have a record for every assignment. Code is managed unit-wise and in every unit there are sub-category for every sprint. Managing code is very easy in this way so using different folder for every unit.
